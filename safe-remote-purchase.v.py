#Safe Remote Purchase (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/solidity-by-example.rst) ported to viper and optimized

#Rundown of the transaction:
#1. Seller posts item for sale and posts safety deposit of double the item value. Balance is 2*value.
#(1.1. Seller can reclaim deposit and close the sale as long as nothing was purchased.)
#2. Buyer purchases item (value) plus posts an additional safety deposit (Item value). Balance is 4*value
#3. Seller ships item
#4. Buyer confirms receiving the item. Buyer's deposit (value) is returned. Seller's deposit (2*value) + items value is returned. Balance is 0.

value: public(wei_value) #Value of the item
